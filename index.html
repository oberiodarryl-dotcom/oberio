  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <p>In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and especially playing Scrabble. What started as a hobby became one of my proudest achievements ‚Äî I joined our school‚Äôs Scrabble competition during the intramurals and won the championship, which led me to represent the school in the ALCU 7 ICL ‚Äì Cebu where my team and I also won first place. Later, we advanced to the ALCU 7 ICL ‚Äì Bohol Regional Championship and proudly became regional champions. Playing Scrabble has taught me discipline, strategy, and teamwork ‚Äî qualities I carry with me in both academics and life.</p>
